						<h4>Cynthia had only heard of Christmas once. She was working at the furnace as usual, shoveling the seemingly infinite supply odf coal into the roaring inferno, when she heard a conversation between two adults. They weren't anyone she recognized, not by voice anyways, but somehow their voices were clearly audible through the industrial chaos.     "You think they'll be doing Christmas this year for the kids?" asked one adult. The other adult sighed.     "They haven't done any kind of holidays for the past few decades we've been working here. What makes you thik they'll start now?"     "We go a real surplus of kids this year, maybe it'll boost worker morales?"     "And since when did anyone care about worker morales?"     That was the end of the conversation Cynthia had heard some years ago. Although many other conversations, people, or concepts had disappeared from her mind, that conversations between two adults somehow stuck with her. Perhaps it was the sadness of their tone, or maybe the mystery of what Christmas even was. To ask anything would be foolish, however. No one asks questions at the Factory. </h4>
