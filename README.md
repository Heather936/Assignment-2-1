						<h4>SCP-2017 is an African-American human female, about 7 years old. It is underweight compared to non-anomalous children, displays symptons of anemia such as gray pallor and cold extremities, and is unusually shy and withdrawn. Its anomalous effect manifests when a human subject makes unprotected skin contact with SCP-2017. The subject experiences a condition tentatively called Sudden Onset Dissociation Disorder, or SCP-2017-Triggered Derealization Disorder. The affected subject recognizes itself as an entity but perceives the external world as foreign and nonsensical. SCP-2017-Triggered Dissociation Disorder will cause subjects to have difficulty understanding or internalizong even the most basic facets of human behavior. Subjects in the late stages of STDD will eventually perceive the entire physical world as lacking order of sense. In addition, affected subjects will uniformly speak of a place or plane of existence they claim possesses the consistency the physical world lacks. Subjects eventually descend into complete self-neglect before ecperiencing heart failure and a longer than noraml period of post-mortem brain activity. Brain death will often be attended with other anomalous phenomena.
						Worth noting is the fact that other than SCP-2017's tacitum nature, it is psychologically healthy and does not suffer from any type of dissociative disorder, anomalous or otherwise.</h4>

						<h4>SCP-2010 appears to be a cell phone made by the Apple Company. The screen has the phrase "PROTOTYPE" scratched onto the glass. The "O"s are unusually large. There are no logos on SCP-2010, as commonly be found on cell phones of the same brand. SCP-2010 also lacks a battery and not work properly. When a subject touches SCP-2010, the cover of "Can't Take my Eyes Off of You" by Walk Off the Earth starts to play through unknown means. The subject drops SCP-2010 once the song starts to play and always falls over near the speackers. They do not move from the spot unless the song has ended. After the song ends, the subject can no longer grasp the concept of eyes. Whenever the subject should sense an eye, they sense an empty area. All test subjects have rejected the fact that they have eyes. </h4>

						<h4>Cynthia had only heard of Christmas once. She was working at the furnace as usual, shoveling the seemingly infinite supply odf coal into the roaring inferno, when she heard a conversation between two adults. They weren't anyone she recognized, not by voice anyways, but somehow their voices were clearly audible through the industrial chaos.     "You think they'll be doing Christmas this year for the kids?" asked one adult. The other adult sighed.     "They haven't done any kind of holidays for the past few decades we've been working here. What makes you thik they'll start now?"     "We go a real surplus of kids this year, maybe it'll boost worker morales?"     "And since when did anyone care about worker morales?"     That was the end of the conversation Cynthia had heard some years ago. Although many other conversations, people, or concepts had disappeared from her mind, that conversations between two adults somehow stuck with her. Perhaps it was the sadness of their tone, or maybe the mystery of what Christmas even was. To ask anything would be foolish, however. No one asks questions at the Factory. </h4>

						<h4>SCP-2033 is a sugar maple tree measuring approximately 5m tall, with its trunk measuring approximately 0.2m in diameter. SCP-2033 displays the normal annual patterns of a non-anomalous tree, although it has not been observed to grow in size since its discovery in 1984. Analysis of SCP-2033's DNA shows no abnormalities.      On SCP-2033's trunk are several pieces of used chewing gum in various stages of decomposition. Analysis reveals these to be chemically identical to normal chewing gum. At an average rate of three times per day, one piece will seperate from SCP-2033 and inflate into a instance of SCP-2033-1.   Any piece of used chewing gum which is attached to SCP-2033 is subject to its anomalous properties. Although it is possible to remove samples from individuals pieces, complete removal has proven impossible.    SCP-2033 was discovered following an impact event on 2/15/1984, in which an object resembling crashed into Site-101's Anomalous Object Laboratory. Further information regarding the event is available to personnel with Level 4 Clearance.  </h4>

						<h4>SCP-2037 is an unknown anomalous species of the Sylvilagus genus. Specimens have an appearance similar to the Sylvilagus audubonii(Desert Cottontail rabbit) species. SCP-2073 also share a common diet with other species in the genus Sylvilagus. Currently the Foundation has 23 live SCP-2037 specimens in containment.     SCP-2037's anomalous properties manifest when specimens detect possible threats. When approached by any unknown or threatening subject, specimens of SCP-2037 will flee from the subject. Specimens are reported to quickly transform its body into a clump of dust while running. When in dust state, SCP-2037 specimens are very resistant to physical harm and are able to travel short distances if strong winds are present. When a significant enough amount of dust is lost, specimens in dust state will try to collect and accumulate dust from its evnvironment. If the loss is too significant to regain, SCP-2037 will decrease in size when returning to normal state.       Specimens in dust state are mainly composed of rabbit fur, flakes of dead skin, lint, and spider webs. No living tissue can be found within the dust partibles. When in normal states, no non-organic substances that are found in the dust state are detected.</h4>
