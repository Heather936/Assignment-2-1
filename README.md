					<p>
						<h4>SCP-2017 is an African-American human female, about 7 years old. It is underweight compared to non-anomalous children, displays symptons of anemia such as gray pallor and cold extremities, and is unusually shy and withdrawn. Its anomalous effect manifests when a human subject makes unprotected skin contact with SCP-2017. The subject experiences a condition tentatively called Sudden Onset Dissociation Disorder, or SCP-2017-Triggered Derealization Disorder. The affected subject recognizes itself as an entity but perceives the external world as foreign and nonsensical. SCP-2017-Triggered Dissociation Disorder will cause subjects to have difficulty understanding or internalizong even the most basic facets of human behavior. Subjects in the late stages of STDD will eventually perceive the entire physical world as lacking order of sense. In addition, affected subjects will uniformly speak of a place or plane of existence they claim possesses the consistency the physical world lacks. Subjects eventually descend into complete self-neglect before ecperiencing heart failure and a longer than noraml period of post-mortem brain activity. Brain death will often be attended with other anomalous phenomena.
						Worth noting is the fact that other than SCP-2017's tacitum nature, it is psychologically healthy and does not suffer from any type of dissociative disorder, anomalous or otherwise.</h4>
